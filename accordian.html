        <h1>About the Bike Routes</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Everyone wants to find the most interesting, safest, and rideable bike route around town, right? We worked with local Duluth bicylcists to determine what a "rideable" bike route would be. It turns out that you know the best routes and turned to Strava.com for ridership maps. </p>
            <p>What's <i>ridership</i>i> you say? Well, we're at least defining <i>ridership</i> as the density of riders, or the number of riders per road throghout the Duluth, MN area. Strava's fantastic app show annual <a href="http://labs.strava.com/heatmap/#9/-92.27005/46.77749/blue/bike" target="_blank">Global Heatmap</a> for all the roads worldwide.</p>
            <p>To digest Strava' data into a biking app for you, we downloaded a copy of the Global Heatmap and analyzed each road within the St. Louis County to associate a "rideability" score. We then use the opensource <a href="http://pgrouting.org/" target="_blank">pgRouting</a> tool for our backend PostGIS/Postgresql database to take your start and end point to create a "rideable" bike route for you!</p>
